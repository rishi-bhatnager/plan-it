Alright so one of the major logistical issues was that users need to set task times. If a mistake is made in predicting these times, which is inevitable, the rest of the schedule is no longer applicable. We then have to re-compile a schedule for their remaining time in the day, which seems to defeat the purpose of making a daily plan. Another issue with the current system is that it must decide how to break up tasks for the user. At times people just get into the flow and want to keep working on something. To tell them to split this up into 30 minute intervals would therefore be counterproductive.

One solution is to schedule by category instead of by task. We map out when they should be doing each of the categories, and during these times they see the to do list of that group of tasks in the order we recommend. This removes a the issue of perfect time prediction on the user's end, since they just work on all their shit roughly in order during these given times. Fitness can be measured by seeing how many things they did in a day. We could have a settings option that lets the user decide if they want to put in the time they expect each task to take, and if so we could give them a specific goal of things to try complete for each work period. This would also help in estimating how much they did in a given day.
